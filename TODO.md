Activate Vanilla elements on demand?

Remember whether each post is Vanilla elements enabled or not.

Hide some of the backend labels to gain space.

Make all fields have a codename with a prefix like `vanilla-elements` or `ve` or
something like that.

IN ORDER TO CREATE A NEW FEATURE WHAT YOU BASICALLY NEED TO DO IS CREATE THE 
STANDALONE ELEMENT, BE IT A SINGLE ELEMENT OR A COMPOSITE ONE (THAT IS A CLONE 
OF OTHER ELEMENTS) AND THEN CREATE THE ACF LAYOUT THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE AS A 
POSSIBLE COLUMN CONTENT.
